    "Control is the lowest layer of the entire unmanned platform system, accepting the planned path and speed information and executing it. It can be further subdivided into lateral control and longitudinal control, corresponding to the operations of stepping on the throttle/brake and turning the steering wheel in the actual driving process. The subsequent courses will attempt to control and plan from the bottom up. If time permits, perception and positioning will be introduced.\n",
    "\n",
    "The name of the Stanley lateral control algorithm comes from the \"Stanley\" team, the champion of the 2005 DARPA Challenge from Stanford University. It is a non-linear feedback function based on the lateral tracking error as the distance from the center of the front axle to the nearest path point, and it can realize the exponential convergence of the lateral tracking error to 0. According to the relative geometric relationship between the vehicle pose and the given path, the control variable for controlling the steering wheel turning angle of the vehicle can be intuitively obtained.\n",
    "\n",
    "The front wheel steering angle control variable consists of two parts: one part is the steering angle caused by the heading error, that is, the angle between the current vehicle body direction and the tangent direction of the nearest point of the reference trajectory; the other part is the steering angle caused by the lateral error, that is, the lateral distance from the center of the front wheel to the nearest point of the reference trajectory.\n",

    "We define the reference point $P_1$ as the point closest to the center of the vehicle's front wheel. There is a point $P_2$ at a distance of $d(t)$ in front of the tangent line of point $P_1$. The basic idea of the Stanley method is to reduce the lateral error $e_y$ and the heading error $\\theta_y$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Without considering lateral errors**, the front wheel should be in line with the tangent direction of the given path reference point. Here, $\\theta_\\varphi$ represents the angle between the vehicle heading and the tangent direction of the nearest path point. In the absence of any lateral errors, the front wheel steering angle $\\delta_\\varphi$ is the same direction as the direction of the path point where it is located.\n",

    "**Without considering the heading error**, the larger the lateral tracking error, the larger the front wheel steering angle. Assuming that the vehicle's expected trajectory intersects with the tangent line of the nearest point on the given path at a distance $d(t)$ from the front wheel. According to the geometric relationship, the following nonlinear proportional function is derived:\n",
